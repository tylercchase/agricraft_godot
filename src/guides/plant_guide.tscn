text = "To plant a seed, click a seed in your inventory to select it then click a square on the left to plant it.

There will be a progress bar that shows up on the square, and when the plant is ready to harvest the label will turn green.

Clicking on the plant while it is growing will speed up the progress.


In order for a plant to crossbreed with another plant, you need to setup a mutation spot (right click) in between two plants with only 2 plants touching the sides of the square. The plants must be fully grown in order to crossbreed with eachother.

Green=Plant, Purple=Mutation Spot
Valid:

Having more than two plants around a spot, makes it invalid.

# Mutation and plant crossbreeding
Follows the basic idea of mendellian genetics with plants inheriting based off the parent plants dominant and recessive genes. ( but a bit of liberty being taken about the actual definitions of these things)

As an example there's a 25% for each of the possibilites with two parents one with speed of 2 dominant and 3 recessive , the other with 4 and 5.

A table for just the speed attribute of the plant. With each square having a equal chance of being selected. Format being (New Dominant)-(New Recessive)
